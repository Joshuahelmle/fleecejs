### FleeceJS
FleeceJS is intended to be a learning Project for Game development in Typescript and my attempt of building a simple Game Engine to understand the concepts of such an engine.

This is not intended to be used in any kind of production environment, if you are looking for a JS GameEngine I can reccomend [ExcaliburJS](https://excaliburjs.com/)
